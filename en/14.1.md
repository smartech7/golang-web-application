# 14.1 Static files

We've already talked about how to deal with static files in previous sections. Now, let's look at how to set up and use static files inside of Beego. Then, through introducing Twitter's open source HTML and CSS framework Bootstrap, we'll be able quickly create beautiful looking websites without having to do much design work.o 

## Beego static files and settings

Go's `net/http` package provides a static file server with functions such as `ServeFile` and `FileServer`. Beego's static file handling is based on this layer, and its specific implementation is as follow: 

	//static file server
	for prefix, staticDir := range StaticDir {
		if strings.HasPrefix(r.URL.Path, prefix) {
			file := staticDir + r.URL.Path[len(prefix):]
			http.ServeFile(w, r, file)
			w.started = true
			return
		}
	}

`StaticDir` stores the URL which corresponds to a static file directory, so when handling requests, we simply need to determine whether or not the URL begins with a static file path. If so, we can simply respond using `http.ServeFile`. 

The following is an example: 

	beego.StaticDir["/asset"] = "/static"

Then, a request with a URL such as `http://www.beego.me/asset/bootstrap.css` will result in `/static/bootstrap.css` being served to the client.

## Bootstrap integration

2. Because beego default values ​​set StaticDir, so if your static files directory is static, then you need not go any further:

	StaticDir["/static"] = "static"

3. templates use the following address on it:

		// css file
		<link href="/static/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet">

		// js file
		<script src="/static/js/bootstrap-transition.js"></script>
